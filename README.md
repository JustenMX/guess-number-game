# Guess the Number Game

### Basic requirements:

1. Set a mystery random number between 1 and 20 - you may hard code the number first.
2. User can input a guess.
3. System outputs status message to tell the user if it was too high, too low or if the user guessed correctly.
4. User can reset the game to play again.

### Challenge - Additional features you can implement:

1. Programmatically generate a random number between 1 and 20 on start and when the game resets.
2. Display the past guesses.
3. Limit the game to 10 attempts.

### Challenge 2 - UseReducer and useContext

1. Refactor number guessing game using useReducer
2. Add scoring - Game starts with 20 points, each wrong guess subtracts the score by 1
3. Create a component ScoreHistory to record the score with React Context
   - when the user clicks on New Game, save the score
   - note that the score is only saved when the user has completed the game
